Hey! My name is Faiza,

I am a third-year student at the University of Toronto, pursuing a dynamic Bachelor of Information degree at the Faculty of Information at the iSchool.

My academic journey began with a focus on psychology and biology, driven by a deep curiosity about what triggers the sensation of aesthetic pleasure in the human brain. It was this curiosity that ultimately led me to discover the realm of design and information, an entire industry dedicated to transforming such aesthetic experiences into a reality.
